How to use SQLite DB in your android app. A detailed tutorial.




Data Persistence:

Android provides several options for you to save persistent application data. The solution you choose depends on your specific needs, such as whether the data should be private to your application or accessible to other applications (and the user) and how much space your data requires.

Your data storage options are the following:

Shared Preferences
Store private primitive data in key-value pairs.

Internal Storage
Store private data on the device memory.

External Storage
Store public data on the shared external storage.

SQLite Databases
Store structured data in a private database.

Network Connection
Store data on the web with your own network server.
